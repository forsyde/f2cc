/**

 *
 * @brief Throws an exception.
 *
 * Throws an exception.
 * 
 * All exceptions require that the name of the source file and the line from
 * which the exception is thrown. Although there are preprocessor macros for
 * getting the file name and line (\c __FILE__ and \c __LINE__), this would be
 * tedious if they would have to be inserted manually into the constructor
 * arguments of the exception (using the macros inside the constructor doesn't
 * work). By using this macro, these required values are automatically added as
 * arguments to the exception so the programmer needn't bother.
 *
 * The macro takes an exception class as mandatory argument, along with a
 * variable list of additional arguments. Thus, an exception of type \c
 * ExampleException, which requires an additional \c int argument, can be thrown
 * as follows:
 * @code
 *    THROW_EXCEPTION(ExampleException, 10);
 * @endcode
 * This is equivalent to writing:
 * @code
 *    throw ExampleException(__FILE__, __LINE__, 10);
 * @endcode
 * If the exception has no additional arguments, the variable list of arguments
 * must be removed entirely, like so:
 * @code
 *    THROW_EXCEPTION(ExampleException);
 * @endcode
 * The following is an \em incorrect use of the macro and causes an syntax error
 * when compiled:
 * @code
 *    THROW_EXCEPTION(ExampleException, );
 * @endcode
 *
 * @param exception_class
 *        Name of the exception class to throw.
 * @param ...
 *        A variable list of additional arguments needed by the exception
 *        constructor. If there are no such arguments, remove this parameter
 *        entirely in the macro call (see description).
